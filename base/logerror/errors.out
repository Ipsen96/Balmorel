   The above check on reasonable consistency between the FLHs calculated from the input variation profile over (SSS,TTT) (the whole year) and over (S,T) (the time segments selected):
   For the calculation and check to make sense is must be assumed that DE_VAR_T and DH_VAR_T are given for a whole year, i.e., CARD(SSS)*CARD(TTT) = 8736 ('whole' year).
   It is also assumed that the weights of the segments is in such full-year case the same for all (SSS,TTT), i.e., the corresponding IHOURSINST(SSS,TTT) are the same for all time segments.
   The above check on Full Load Hours FLH was made with a tolerance on the quotient of 0.100.
   CARD(S)*CARD(T) is    2, if this number is much smaller than 8736 this may be the explanation, e.g. if the S and T selected do not contain DE_VAR_T or DH_VAR_T values that are representative for the whole year.
